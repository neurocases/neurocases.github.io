<b>C.C:</b> 65 y.o female presented with slurred speech, left hand incoordination since last night.

<b>HPI:</b>Last night, patient was going to bed and at that time she was feeling completely at baseline. As time was going by, patient started to feel a little "off" but unable to describe exactly how. Around midnight, she developed a headache to her nasal bridge between her eyes. Patient decided to get up to take some
tylenol for her headache and when she got up from the bed, she felt like her coordination was off. When she got to the
bathroom and tried to turn the faucet on with her left hand, she felt uncoordinated. Patient reports when she tried to take her
tylenol, she noticed that water was coming out of the left side of her mouth but she was able to swallow the pills without any
difficulty. Denies any numbness/tingling to either side of her body. Patient then went back to bed and then woke up the next
morning and her headache was gone. She still felt like she had some hand incoordination. Was able to drink her coffee without
any issues. She called her cousin and during that time patient felt that her speech was slurred and this was the first time
that she noticed it as she lives alone. She denies having difficulty with word finding. 

In the ED: BP 150/88, HR 70-80s. NIHSS: 2 (left facial droop).
